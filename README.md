The UI Layout was generated using prompting in FigmaAI, then edited using the dev mode. The code in this repository was developed using the FigmaAI, working with ChatGPT to translate into basic HTML and CSS, and then manually editing to get the exact style & format I wanted in order to fit this assignment.
